# Among Us Tasks Simulator

Among Us Tasks Simulator. A fan project dedicated to greatly increasing how SPEEDY you are at doing your tasks. Just make sure you have an excuse when you take 0.2 seconds to do wires in front of everyone.

This is my first time making a github repository/page so hopefully this actually works.

Idk if this is legal so if it isn't legal I guess you can email me: gamingkitty.potatoes@gmail.com (ignore my cringy email address)
